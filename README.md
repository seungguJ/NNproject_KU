# Discovering deficiencies of neural networks
## Goal
- Find adversarial examples which are added human imperceptible noise
## Motivations
Thanks to the outstanding performance and stable capability, deep neural networks are now widely used in various areas, e.g., image classification, object detection, malware detection and behavior classification.

However in recent, deep neural networks are revealed fragile to adversarial perturbation. So it is important to discover the deficiencies of deep neural networks to debug the models
